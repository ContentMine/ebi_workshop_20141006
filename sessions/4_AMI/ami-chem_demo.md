# AMI-Chem

## Overview

Extracts complete chemical structures and 2-D coordinates from vector-based chemical diagrams

* Input: SVG diagram or PDF containing PDFs
* Output: CML including group expansion and coordinates from image
* Output: PNG (coordinates generated by CDK)
* Output: SVG (coordinates generated by CDK)
* Output: SMILES 
* Output: results.xml (contains CML)
* Method: extracts vectors and characters from diagram and builds an (organic) chemical structure
* Note: Does NOT run OSCAR or OPSIN and does not translate names
* Limitation: Does not run on HTML or XML or PDF text (will have separate plugin for that)
* Limitation: Does not run on pixel images (but will very soon)
* Limitation: Can extract, but does not understand, dotted bonds, thick bonds, wiggly bonds (and nor do most humans)
* Limitation: hardcoded list of chemical groups.

## Example

Taken from Metabolites 2012, 2, 39-56; doi:10.3390/metabo2010039. "Comparative Chemistry of Aspergillus oryzae (RIB40) and
A. flavus (NRRL 3357" which contains names and structures on many metabolites and metabolic reactions.
