Extracting phylogenetic tree data from images with ami-tree
============================

 * You will be provided (electronically) with some freely available articles from a journal called *International Journal of Systematic & Evolutionary Microbiology* (IJSEM). Although technical you should be able to carry out this exercise without any deep scientific knowledge.
 * Work on your own or in pairs.
 * The aim of this exercise is to extract computationally-reusable information from published scientific figures, in this case; phylogenies. The topology, branch lengths & tip labels will all be extracted from the image(s) so they can reused & re-analysed. 

 Phylogenetic Trees

RM Say something brief here about what a phylogenetic tree is

* one
* two
* three
