Şenay is an expert in text mining. She works in Jo McEntyre's literature services team at EBI. During this session she will be describing how to turn semistructured documents into normalised XML, and then explaining the role of SectionTagger. We will then see a demonstration of the SectionTagger software in combination with scrapers developed by the ContentMine team.
