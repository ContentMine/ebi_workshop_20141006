#OVERVIEW

### Openness

We believe in Open (free to use, reuse and redistribute)
as a constructive approach for more effecient, harmonious, community-aware code and protocols. Everything
related to this workshop is Open by default. (We will not publish emails and personal data). We expect as part of good practice
that contributions are formally acknowledged but this is not a legal/licence requirement. The session may be tweeted which
frequently brings additional remote participants. The session will be human-recorded but not video/audio recorded.

## General goals for the workshop

* for participants to get and communicate an understanding of how contentmining can be used in bioscience.
* to explore use-cases.
* to explore the role of community in contentmining.
* to see what commonality exists between EBI/EuropePMC and contentmine.org and medium-term opportunities for working together 
 (code, materials, standards, advocacy, workshops, etc.).

## Help

There are 6-8 members of the ContentMine team present and they are delighted to work with individuals or groups as required.
Do not suffer in silence!

## Methods of working

In the morning and post-lunch the material is designed for individuals or small groups. In this you should follow the instructions
as faithfully as possible. After Tea the working is free-form and could include:

* a group investigating a particular use case
* an individual learning how to use a specific piece of code
* a group exploring a policy of practice area
* a group discussing integration and creation of communal resources.

## Code and examples

The code varies between very robust (deployed, used and published) to alpha (active but flexible development). In the morning
and post-lunch the examples should work as shown. 

After tea there is more flexibility. We shall suggest "extension exercises" where we are reasonaly confident that few or 
minor problems occur. Some delegates may wish to go into new territory and there we expect 
the unexpected.  Any new document (especially PDF) may have features that break the system. A new chemical type can cause 
problems. A complex annotated phylogentic tree will almost certainly fail.

### Precision and recall

Always remember that Mining is not a well-defined process. Almost all mining has false positives and negatives. It's valuable to 
log these rather than complain "it gets this wrong". Selling P/R to the wider community is a shared, difficult task.

## Final discussion

Chaired by Jenny Molloy who has had several years in this area, running workshops and has taken the lead in our recent FutureTDM.
Please think about what constructive ways forward we can pursue.
