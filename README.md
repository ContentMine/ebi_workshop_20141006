Invitation Letter
=================

Dear all,

Thanks for singing up for the Text Mining Hands-on Workshop by Peter Murray-Rust which 

is going to take place this Monday (06/Oct/2014).

We would like to share further information about the workshop with you.

Workshop Program: Please find attached the workshop program (the shared google doc will 

be attached).

Prerequisites:

Attendees are expected to understand how to run from the commandline, and install 

packages. Some packages are required to be installed to your laptops in advanced in order to 

run the ContentMine pipeline which is going to be used in the hands-on parts. Please follow 

the steps below and install the required packages before coming to the workshop.

(Waiting for Richard to contact me about that)

You are welcome to bring a typical use case to the workshop. If you have any use 

case, please send (Peter/Richard?) (ideally before the workshop) a link (DOI?, PMID) to 

an OpenAccess paper/article typical of your current interests. Indicate what you would 

like to mine from one or more such papers. We can discuss (or even prototype) how to do 

simple mining tasks for well-defined entities which can be scientific terms or metadata 

(bibliography, rights, etc.). Where possible indicate dictionaries/bibliographies/ontologies, 

etc. which can be used for identifiers.

Reminder:

The Workshop will take place between 9:30 -17:00 in the room A2-33 (main EBI building). 

Donâ€™t forget to bring your own laptop.

See you this monday,

Senay, Jo, Peter, Richard
