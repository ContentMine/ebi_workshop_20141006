# Markup higlighted exercise

[This exercise has been run in all workshops as an "icebreaker" and works very well. 
Here we extend it for informatics professionals to include ideas of precision/recall and also final target vocabularies.]

* You will be provided with paper copies of pages from one (or two) scientific articles. Although technical you should be able to
carry out this exercise without any deep scientific knowledge
* Work in about 4 groups of up to 6 people. Each person has a different highlighter pen to markup up *entities* in the article. 
(code below)
* Mark up all entities in each page starting at the top (only mark new entities and stop after 10). Swap the pages within the 
group so each gets exposed to every marker pen.

## Entities

An entity is a complete nounal word or phrase which can/could be found in a systematic taxonomy or definition. 
Thus "1984", "Pleistocene", "5 minutes" could be marked as date/times, while "recently" would be too fuzzy.
