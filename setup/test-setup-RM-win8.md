Following instructions from https://github.com/ContentMine/ebi_workshop_20141006/blob/master/setup/pre-workshop_installation.pdf

* Downloaded VM (it took about 6mins at 5MB/s over PMR's home wireless)
* Installed Virtualbox just clicking through all the defaults, changing nothing

Double-clicked on the downloaded VM file and these screens appear:
